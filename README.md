# Hello!

This repo contains the exersises from the glorious "A book on C", by Al Kelley and Ira Pohl. 
I am Data Science bachelor student, actually learning by myself, since I am a worker too! Because of that, the collection of excercises does not have the ambition to be neither precise nor complete. It is simply the product of my practice.

I refer, mainly, to the italian edition of the book:
    C - Didattica e programmazione, quarta edizione, 2004.
Even so, you may find material and comments from the english edition.

At thet time of the first upload, the book is complete up to Chapter 6, except for the advanced exercises. 

- Each chapter has a dedicated folder (ex. ch5, ch6...);
- exercises are numbered ch5.1.c, ch5.2.c. 
- file without .number such as ch5.c are exercises wrote during the study of theory sections;
- few input and output text files will wildly appear and disappear in the main folder.

## Chapter 7 is on the way!
